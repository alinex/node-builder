[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/alinex/node-builder.png)](https://gemnasium.com/alinex/node-builder)

This package contains some helper commands for development of the alinex
node packages. This is a superset of npm and other command line tools.

It may help a lot while developing to automatize the consequently done tasks.

- easy to use build tool
- supporting complete process
- specialized for the alinex modules
- extensible

It is one of the modules of the [Alinex Universe](http://alinex.github.io/node-alinex)
following the code standards defined there.


Motivation
-------------------------------------------------
While developing an automated build tool always help saving time and make things
magic and smooth.

My first intention was to use the standardized tools so I looked at Bower and
Cake. To have more possibilities above the tasks I decided to create a Cakefile.
This was a good way but over time it got bloated.

Because the general tasks are easy but have to be modularized I decided to
separate them into build tasks which stay in the package and overall management
tasks which were moved out into this helper tool.


Installation
-------------------------------------------------

It may be installed globally as an universal helper or integrated into a package
as development dependency.

Install the package globally using npm:

    > npm install -g alinex-builder --production
    > builder --help

After global installation you may directly call `builder` from anywhere.

Or you may integrate it into your own package

    > npm install alinex-builder --save-devs
    > ./node_modules/.bin/builder --help

By integrating it you won't need all the development tools within your package.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/alinex-builder.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/alinex-builder/)


Usage
-------------------------------------------------

The tool will be called with

    > builder [general options] -c <command> [command options] [dirs]

but if not installed globally you may run

    > node_modules/.bin/builder [general options] -c <command> ...

With the option `--help` a screen explaining all commands and options will be
displayed. The major commands will be described here.

Multiple directory names can be given. They specify on which project to work on.
It should point to the base package directory of a module. If not specified the
command will run from the current directory.


### General options

`-v`or `--verbose` will display a lot of information of what is going on.
This information will sometimes look discarded because of the parallel
processing of some tasks.

`-C` or `--no-colors` can be used to disable the colored output.


















### Command `create`

Create a new package from scratch. This will create:

* the directory
* make some initial files
* init git repository
* setup github repository
* add and commit everything

The create task needs the `--password` setting to access github
through the api. And you may specify the `--package` setting for the npm name
of the package. The also mandatory path will be used as the github repository
name, too.

Some example calls will look like:

    > alinex-make -c create ./node-error --package alinex-error
    > alinex-make -c create ./private-module --private

This process is interactive and will ask you some more details. After that you
may directly start to add your code.


### Command `push`

This will push the changes to the origin repository. With the `--message` option
it will also add and commit all other changes before doing so.

    > alinex-make -c push                  # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c push ./node-error     # or from anywhere else

or to also commit the last changes

    > alinex-make -c push ./node-error --message "commit message"


### Command `pull`

Like `push` this will fetch the newest changes from git origin.

    > alinex-make -c pull                  # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c pull ./node-error     # or from anywhere else

    Pull from origin
    Von https://github.com/alinex/node-make
     * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD


### Command `compile`

This task is used to compile the sources into for runtime optimized library.

    > alinex-make -c compile               # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c compile ./node-error  # or from anywhere else

    Remove old lib directory
    Compile coffee script


Or give an directory and use uglify to compress the **just now experimental**
extension. It works for live server but will break source maps for node-error
and makes your coverage report unreadable.

    > alinex-make -c compile ../node-error --uglify

Mostly this task will be added as prepublish script to the `package.json` like:

    "scripts": {
      "prepublish": "node_modules/.bin/alinex-make compile -u"
    }

Also this will make man files from mardown documents in `src/man` if they
are referenced in the package.json.


### Command `install`

This task is a handy addition to include the npm install and npm update commands:

    > alinex-make -c install               # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c install ./node-error  # or from anywhere else

Or give an directory and use update to also update all packages to the newest
possible one.

    > alinex-make -c install ../node-error --update


### Command `test`

As a first test a coffeelint check will be run. Only if this won't have any
errors the automatic tests will be run.

If the [istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) module is installed
a code coverage report will be build.

    > alinex-make -c test                  # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c test ./node-error     # or from anywhere else

    Linting coffee code
    Run mocha tests

      Simple mocha test
        âœ“ should add two numbers

      1 passing (9ms)

Or to contineously watch it:

    > alinex-make -c test ./node-error --watch

You may also create an html coverage report:

    > alinex-make -c test --coverage

And at last you can add the `--browser` flag to open the coverage report
automatically in the browser. Also `--coveralls` may be added to send the
results to coveralls.

This task can also be added to the `package.json` to be called using `npm test`:

    "scripts": {
      "test": "node_modules/.bin/alinex-make test"
    }


### Command: `doc`

Generate the documentation this will create the documentation in the `doc`
folder. It includes the API documentation with code. Each module will get his
own documentation space with an auto generated index page.

This tool will extract the documentation from the markup and code files in
any language and generate HTML pages with the documentation beside the
code.

    > alinex-make -c doc                   # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c doc ./node-error      # or from anywhere else

    Create html documentation
    Done.

It is also possible to update the documentation stored on any website. To
configure this for GitHub pages, you have to do nothing, for all others you
need to specify an `doc-publish` script in `package.json`. This may be an
rsync copy job like `rsync -av --delete doc root@myserver:/var/www`.
Start the document creation with publication using:

    > alinex-make -c doc ./node-error --publish

With the `--watch` option it is possible to keep the documentation updated.

    > bin/make doc ../node-error --watch

But this process will never end, you have to stop it manually to end it.

And at last you may also add the `--browser` flag to open the documentation in
the browser after created.

The style of the documentation can be specified if a specific css is present
in the alinex make package. It have to be under the path `src/data` and be called
by the `<basename>.css` while basename is the package name before the first
hyphen.


### Command `changes`

This will list all changes (checkins) which are done since the last publication.
Use this to check if you should make a new publication or if it can wait.

    > alinex-make -c changes

    Changes since last publication:
    - Small bugfix in creating docs for non alinex packages.
    - Fixed internal links in documentation.
    - Changed created script calls to support newer make.
    - Updated to use newest make version in created files.
    - Fixed create task which was completely buggy since last rewrite.


### Command `publish`

With the push command you can publish your newest changes to github and npm as a
new version. The version can be set by signaling if it should be a `--major`,
`--minor` or bugfix version if no switch given.

To publish the next bugfix version only call:

    > alinex-make -c publish               # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c publish ./node-error  # or from anywhere else

    Change package.json
    Write new changelog
    Commit new version information
    Push to git origin
    To https://github.com/alinex/node-make
       a06c5ec..c93df17  master -> master
    Push new tag to git origin
    To https://github.com/alinex/node-make
     * [new tag]         v0.4.6 -> v0.4.6
    Push to npm
    Created v0.4.6.


For the next minor version (second number) call:

    > alinex-make -c publish ../node-error --minor

And for a new major version:

    > alinex-make -c publish ../node-error --major


### Command: `clean`

Remove all automatically generated files. This will bring you to the initial
state of the system. To create a usable system you have to build it again.

To clean everything which you won't need for a production environment use
`--dist` or `--auto` to remove all automatically generated files in the
development environment.

To cleanup all safe files:

    > alinex-make -c clean                 # from within the package directory
    > alinex-make -c clean ./node-error    # or from anywhere else

Or on the development system remove all created files:

    > alinex-make -c clean ../node-error --auto

And at last for production remove development files:

    > alinex-make -c clean ../node-error --dist


Configuration
-------------------------------------------------

### Document Template

You may specify a different document layout by creating a file named like the
main part of your package (name till the first hyphen). Use the file
`/var/src/docstyle/default.css` as a default and store your own in
`/var/local/docstyle/<basename>.css`.

Also the javascript may be changed for each package basename in `<basename>.js`
like done for the css.
